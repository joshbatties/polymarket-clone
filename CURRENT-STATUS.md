- Repository pattern needs updating to Prisma client

### 🎯 **Type Compatibility (15 errors)**
- Prisma null vs string type mismatches in seed files
- Missing required fields in some Prisma operations
- Interface property alignment issues

### 🔍 **Service Dependencies (12 errors)** 
- Observability services reference removed TelemetryService
- KYC module imports non-existent PrismaModule
- Crypto service uses deprecated Node.js crypto methods

### 🧪 **Testing & Development (11 errors)**
- Some test files have incomplete variable definitions
- Demo/testing code with API interface mismatches
- Prisma service event listener compatibility

## 📱 **Mobile App Status**

The React Native app is **architecturally complete** with:

✅ **Implemented Features:**
- Complete trading interface (buy/sell screens)
- Portfolio tracking with real-time P&L
- Secure authentication with biometric support
- Stripe payment integration
- KYC document upload flow
- Responsible gambling settings
- Security features (TLS pinning, root detection)

🔧 **Needs Package Updates:**

## 🛠️ **Next Steps to Complete**

### **Immediate (2-4 hours)**
1. **Fix Auth System**: Convert TokenService from TypeORM to Prisma
2. **Add Missing User Methods**: Implement validateUser, findByIdOrThrow  
3. **Fix Type Mismatches**: Update null assignments to match Prisma schemas
4. **Update Mobile Dependencies**: Install missing packages

### **Short-term (1-2 days)**
1. **Complete Testing**: Restore simplified test files
2. **Documentation**: Finalize API documentation
3. **Environment Setup**: Complete production environment configuration

## 🚀 **Production Readiness**
